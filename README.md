#Xoltar-Sharp

This is a utility library for .Net. It contains useful tools for solving real problems and reducing the amount of work needed to do something useful. I hope you find it helpful.

Currently it has not been released and is still in the early stages of development. Nevertheless, anything you find in the master branch should be unit tested.
